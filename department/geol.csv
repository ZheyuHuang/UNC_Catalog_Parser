GEOL 655,"  Recent Advances in Non-Traditional Stable Isotope Geochemistry",3,"
This seminar will introduce students to state of the art analytical techniques, current theories, and their applications in various geological processes regarding the non-traditional stable isotopes (e.g., Li, Mg, Fe, Mo, and Cr). After introducing some basic principles and analytical techniques of these so called "non-traditional" stable isotopes, students will present and discuss recent literature in this arena.",,"QI.",,"Letter grade.
